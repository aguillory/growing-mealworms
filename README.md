# growing-mealworms
This isn't even about programming- I just can't think of a better way to post this article to the public LOL. Re-posting this from a private forum.

Figured I'd do another DIY infodump today. Today's topic: Mealworms.

Background: I have reptiles and grow mealworms for their food. A lot of people grow them as food or treats for their quail and poultry. They're easy to do and quick to breed so let's get right into it. You can get as big or as little with this as you want, you can go as simplistic or detailed as you want.

Lifecycle and buying: Let’s talk time, everyone wants to know how long is it going to take. Likely you will begin with buying mealworms from a pet store or online. That is the most common, easiest, and probably cheapest method. When you go to purchase them, make sure you get regular mealworms. They are typically sold in plastic cups with lids and come in various sizes (like small, medium, and large) and counts (50, 100, 500). Do NOT get giant mealworms. They are mealworms fed a growth hormone, and it tends to make them sterile when they pupate (if they make it to that stage at all). Superworms are not mealworms, they are a similar looking, giant cousin of the mealworm. They can be bred but require special care compared. I will discuss that later. When you get your first batch of mealworms, they are in the larval (larvae) form, the second stage of life, immediately following eggs. This stage of life lasts 3-4 months in total, according to what size you get them at, they may be at the end of this stage or near the middle. During this stage of their life, they eat and eat, grow and molt up to 20 times before finally reaching their final ‘worm’ size and then curling up and ‘pupating’. The pupae is the third stage of four life stages. This stage lasts around 2-3 weeks, and pupae do not eat or move much during this stage. This makes pupae an easy target for hungry, cannibalistic beetles (more on this later). After 2-3 weeks, they emerge out of the pupae shell as a darkling beetle, the final stage. Within 2 weeks of becoming an adult beetle, they will begin reproducing and continue to do so for several months, until they eventually pass away. The eggs they lay will take from 4 to 20 days to hatch. From purchased cup of mealworms to your first cup of home-grown mealworms, you are looking to wait anywhere between a month and a half to six months at the latest.

Bedding/substrate/food: Whatever you put mealworms in will be their food. And whatever they eat, inevitably ends up inside of whatever you feed the worms to. There are a variety of commonly used beddings in mealworm production. Most professionals use wheat bran or rice bran, as it fits perfectly through a commonly used sifting system (more on that later). You can also use rolled oats, whole oats, cereal, or even chicken feed. You won’t provide them with any liquids, but you will need to provide them with vegetables weekly for hydration. Most people typically use potatoes or carrots as the vegetable of hydration for their mealworms, as they’re cheap, slow to rot or mold, and easy to sift out/remove to replace. You can also feed your mealworms scraps – from stale bread to vegetables. The more variety and nutrients you put in your mealworms, the more they will provide to what you feed the mealworms to.

Now the big decision topic – setup. The only limit to your mealworm setup is your imagination. Seriously. If you’re just starting out and want to experiment and try them out, you can just simply get a large tote, put in some bedding/food of choice, and leave them be. No work required, other than plopping in a vegetable now and then and getting out the mealworms when you’re ready to feed them off. For my first setup, I used a $7 18-gallon tote, filled it with a 50lb bag of whole oats, and put in a cup of mealworms. I still have this setup, I used it to start my new colonies and I still use it to throw in large scraps and small deceased animals. Because of the huge variety of foods that they eat, they are some of my fattest mealworms. The reason this setup is not optimal is because beetles, pupae, worms, and eggs are all in the same container. Beetles become cannibalistic and will snack on vulnerable pupae and eggs (since they don’t move). This means you will ultimately have less production than if you used a better setup. However, this set up is easy for anyone and requires almost no work except for when you want to harvest the mealworms.  See photo 1 for my ‘dump bin’. It’s not pretty, but it works.

The ‘better way’ requires a bit of up-front work, and slightly more maintenance, but will produce much better. It can be small or scaled up quite large. The basic idea is that you will have a container for your beetles and you will have a container or containers for mealworm grow-outs. I will show several photo examples of my various setups. An idea for a small setup would be a three-drawer desktop organizer / makeup organizer. You can browse thrift shops, yard sales, and discount stores for cheap multi drawer organization shelves/carts like I did, and have a variety of setups. One that’s really cool is 10 or 20 drawer rainbow rolling shelf carts. They’re the perfect size for having a constant small supply of mealworms. None of this has to be difficult or expensive! You can also build your own if you are crafty. I made one out of 2x1”’s that fits over twenty of the dollar store shoebox sized storage bins (6qt) (photo 2). However big or small you make it - the concept is the same. The top-most drawer/container will have the bottom cut out and replaced with a mesh screen. You can use a heat gun and knife, a lighter and knife, or a hot knife to cut the plastic out. The mesh screen can be an old window screen, a screen door screen, or even a dollar store splash guard. You can make it work with what you’ve got or can get cheaply! Beetles will be placed in here with very little or no bedding and will reproduce. The eggs will fall through the mesh to another container below, being your mealworm grow out.

Typically, you will also have a ‘pupae bridge’ in the beetle container, so that when you put pupae that you are keeping to replace your beetles as they age, they will not be cannibalized by the existing beetles. A ‘bridge’ can be quite easy to make by reusing the portion of the bottom you cut out of the container, cutting it down and using a flame to soften the plastic and making a 90-degree bend as legs on both sides. As long as the beetles can’t crawl up it, and you can put pupae on top of it, you’ll be good. Once the pupae turn into beetles, they’ll crawl around until they fall off down with the rest of the beetles, and then they’ll be stuck down there. You can use other things as well for a pupae bridge, such as an overturned bowl or cup. Photo 3 and 4-6 shows my existing beetle bin and my new beetle bin made for the tall shelf. On each one I have a pupae bridge ‘glued’ to the front with screen on it to provide grip for the newly hatched beetles. I use screen door screen and zip ties plus glue to affix the screen to the bin.

Once you have the beetles in there, it’s not very much work. I provide vegetables for hydration the same way I do for mealworms, but do not provide food as they do not eat very much during this life phase. I put a piece of egg carton or a toilet paper roll in there as they love to eat it and hide in it. I actually do this for every bin, mealworms too. They all seem to love it. The ‘beetle bin’ stays at the top and then you can rotate your remaining bins below it. If you choose to only have one mealworm bin, you will just need to do maintenance on it to remove pupae, remove adult worms to feed off, etc. If you have more than one bin, create a schedule to rotate the remaining bins. The longest you should leave a tray under the beetles is 3-4 months because that is the time it takes from egg to pupae. Typically, you would divide 3-4 months by the number of bins you are rotating to make the schedule. For example, if you’ve got 3 grow out bins, then you would rotate them monthly. If you’ve got 6 bins, then rotate them every other week. The goal is that when you’ve reached the point where your first drawer is to go back to under the beetle drawer, you should be able to remove all the mealworms to feed them off and start over.

Please remember that your beetles don’t live forever. When you start taking worms out to feed, if you don’t have any that have already turned, you will want to keep a few worms to continue to grow until they pupate. You can leave them in the drawer as you place them under the beetles and when you next rotate the bin, you should be able to move the pupae. Now that we’ve covered the setup, we need to discuss maintenance.

Maintenance: Removing and sorting worms can be done in a variety of ways, from manual removal (free) to panning/sifting to machine sorting (expensive!!!). Most larger scale home farmers use the green colored gold panning sifters. They come in a mini set (http://tinyurl.com/minisifters)) and a full set (tinyurl.com/bucketsifter). The full set fits comfortably on a 5-gallon bucket. The mini set costs around $60 and the full set costs around $100. I personally have the full-sized set, but I only just recently purchased it so that I could more efficiently do maintenance. Before purchasing the sifter, I did all of my maintenance manually. You can also buy various sizes of colanders at the dollar store or other things to assist in maintenance. The goal of maintenance is to 1. Get out old vegetables, 2. Discard dead mealworms/beetles, 3. Separate good bedding from frass (insect poop), 4. And get your worms out so you can feed them to your other creatures! After buying the green sifting set, my life was changed. Mealworms are so much easier now and I’m able to scale up massively with so much less time wasted with manual maintenance. The only thing I had to change was what bedding I used, as the whole oats sat in the same layer as my adult mealworms, so it was hard to pick them out. Using smaller substrate (wheat bran, chicken crumble) or larger substrate (cereal) resolves this problem completely. It allows me to just grab a few bins at a time, dump them in the top of the sifting set, and shake a few times. Photos 7-11 show the various layers of sifting, from old food, to large worms, medium worms, small worms, and finally frass. If you use any sort of sifter, I’ll provide what the various mesh sizes do. You can use this to find mesh of the same size and make your own, if you prefer. This is copied and pasted from Space Cost Mealworms and shared about various mealworm groups.

Mesh screen sizes: 1/2", 1/4", 1/8", 1/12", 1/20"

Stackable design sits nicely in a 5-gallon bucket.

Notice the 1/30th is NOT in this 5pc set. It must be purchased separately (https://tinyurl.com/130mesh)..)

Top tray (1/2) - holes are too large to catch any worms, but useful for catching larger food chunks that may be hidden in the substrate. It’s also the perfect place to hold the pupae sifter insert, sold by Space Coast Mealworms.

2nd tray (1/4) - most worms fall through still. Useful for catching superworm beetles and smaller food chunks. Some larger worms do get caught, but fall through with enough shakes or time.

3rd tray (1/8) - This is your workhorse. It catches ALL beetles and most large worms ready to be sold. May also catch some large pupae. Some smaller worms get caught in it if not shaken enough.

4th tray (1/12) - This size catches all medium-large worms. These may be sold or kept to grow larger, depending on your customers. Will also catch the rest of your pupae.

5th tray (1/20) - catches all small worms and large pieces of bran. At this point all frass falls through along with small bran pieces and eggs.

6th tray (1/30) - catches ALL small bran and allows only frass to fall through.  Not certain if 1/30 catches eggs since most farmers don’t sift their egg trays.

For me, using chicken feed as my substrate, the 4th tray catches all my worms and the 5th tray catches all my substrate. Once you've got your mealworms separated, you can feed the extras or put them in your fridge to hold their growth until you're ready to feed them off. You can dry them too. Start the process over again, and it’s all smooth sailing. All you have to do then is to add in substrate as needed and put in a chunk of veggie once a week. Mealworms like it warm and dry, I have them in the same room as I do my incubator and reptiles, its kept at around 75-80F all the time and the mealworms LOVE it.

Photo 12 is an example bin of mine, showing mealworms in their bedding (chicken feed) and their molted exoskeletons on top. After I sift them, I use a vacuum held about 1 inch above the exoskeletons to suck them up, as at that distance, the thin sheds will float up and the mealworms are too heavy to pick up.

Mealworm/beetle trap: Take a 2-liter bottle (or even a regular soda bottle would work), and cut it a little below the thickest part. Stick a chunk of lovely moist vegetable in (like potato) and then flip the neck of the bottle inside of itself. Stick it in your mealworm bin, with the substrate just to the hole in the neck of the bottle so they can just crawl in and fall in with the veggie. The vegetable moisture will attract them, they'll fall in, and can't crawl back out. Works great! (see photos 12-14)

Got a beetle you're trying to catch? Put a small piece of egg carton down and leave the bin/tray/whatever in a bright room. The worms and beetles don't like bright light so they'll crawl under the egg carton and then it's super easy to move the beetles.

Wish you could do this but you don't like icky bugs? I have a literal phobia of worms. I still squirm sometimes when I touch them and they wiggle, but by golly I worked my butt off and I can do it! Start small, take breaks. You can do it. I still can't touch fishing worms, but at least I can do this.
